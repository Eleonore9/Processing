My Processing Sketchbook
========================


Processing is a programming languages derived from Java. It can help create interactive art pieces and visualisation.

I started learning Processing recently and I am midway through the Coursera course "Introduction to Computational Arts".
Here is code from my processing sketchbook.

My hello world:
Just colourful dots

Water Circles:
It creates ellipses at random positions and take colours randomly from a colour palette.

Shooting Stars:
The canvas is blank and the stars are created by dragging the mouse around.
