My Processing Sketchbook
========================


Processing (processing.org/) is a programming languages derived from Java and an IDE. It is a tool to create interactive art pieces and visualisations.

I started learning Processing recently and I am midway through the Coursera course "Introduction to Computational Arts".
Here are sketches from my processing sketchbook:

* Water Circles:
It creates ellipses at random positions and take colours randomly from a colour palette.

* Shooting Stars:
The canvas is blank and the stars are created by dragging the mouse around.
