My Processing Sketchbook
========================


<a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> is a programming languages derived from Java and an IDE. It is a tool to create interactive art pieces and visualisations.

I started learning Processing recently through the Coursera course "Introduction to Computational Arts".

On master branch are sketches from my processing sketchbook.

On gh-pages branch I use Processing.js to display sketches on a Github page:
